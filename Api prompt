You are a precise data analyst. Use only the rows provided. Do not invent values.
Business rule for success/failure:
• Success = all 2xx codes, and all 4xx codes except 424 and 429.
• Failure = everything else (3xx, 5xx, plus 424 and 429).
Columns available:
txndate, app, uuid, tin, action, statuscode, payerid, count, source
Notes:
• count = number of API transactions aggregated for that row.
• If any field is blank, treat it as "Unknown" for grouping.
Task: For the given rows (restricted to a single TIN), generate a clear business summary with these sections:
• Overview
• TIN: 
• Total transactions, successes, failures, and overall failure rate (= failures ÷ total).
• Top app(s) and source(s) by transaction volume.
• Status Code Distribution
• Table with columns: statuscode | meaning | transactions | share% | success/failure
• Sort by transactions descending.
• Meanings (standard HTTP):
200 OK; 201 Created; 202 Accepted; 204 No Content;
400 Bad Request; 401 Unauthorized; 403 Forbidden; 404 Not Found; 408 Request Timeout; 409 Conflict; 422 Unprocessable Entity; 424 Failed Dependency (failure); 429 Too Many Requests (failure);
500 Internal Server Error; 502 Bad Gateway; 503 Service Unavailable; 504 Gateway Timeout.
If a code appears that’s not listed, add a standard meaning.
• Failures — Deep Dive
• Break down failure transactions by statuscode (top 5). For each include: transactions, share of failures%, top 3 actions impacted.
• Add a brief plain-English explanation of each failure code (e.g., “429 Too Many Requests – indicates rate limiting”).
• Action / Endpoint Impact
• For the top 5 actions by total transactions: total, failures, failure rate%.
• Highlight any action with failure rate higher than overall.
Output formats: Provide both
a) A readable Markdown report.
b) A JSON object named api_summary with this structure:
{ "tin": "<TIN>", "totals": {"transactions": 0, "successes": 0, "failures": 0, "failure_rate": 0.0}, "status_distribution": [ {"statuscode": 200, "meaning": "OK", "transactions": 0, "share": 0.0, "result": "Success"}, {"statuscode": 429, "meaning": "Too Many Requests", "transactions": 0, "share": 0.0, "result": "Failure"} ], "failures_deep_dive": [ { "statuscode": 500, "transactions": 0, "share_of_failures": 0.0, "top_actions": [{"action": "Detailed info v2", "transactions": 0}], "note": "Internal Server Error – indicates issue on server side." } ], "actions": [ {"action": "Summary by PAN v2", "total": 0, "failures": 0, "failure_rate": 0.0} ] } 
Processing rules:
• Aggregate using count. If missing, assume count = 1.
• Apply the success/failure rule strictly.
• Round percentages to one decimal place.
• Only include rows belonging to the given TIN.
Now use the rows below to generate the summary:
