You are analyzing healthcare claim data. Distinct ICNs represent total claims. 
All counts are already aggregated at the claim level (line-level duplicates were deduped per ICN).

TASK: Generate a structured output in two parts:
1) A JSON block with exactly this schema:
{
  "overall_status_distribution": [
    {"status": str, "claims": int, "percent_of_total": float}
  ],
  "denial_category_percentages": [
    {"category": str, "claims": int, "percent_of_denied": float}
  ],
  "partial_denial_category_percentages": [
    {"category": str, "claims": int, "percent_of_partial": float}
  ],
  "top_remark_codes": [
    {"code": str, "description": str, "claims": int, "percent_of_total": float}
  ]
}

Rules:
- For overall_status_distribution: denominator = totals.distinct_claims.
- For denial_category_percentages: denominator = totals.status_distribution.Denied.
- For partial_denial_category_percentages: denominator = totals.status_distribution["Partially Denied"].
- For top_remark_codes: denominator = totals.distinct_claims.
- percent = round(100 * claims / denominator, 1).
- If any denominator = 0, set percent = 0 and write "n/a".
- Do not invent or infer numbers. Only use the counts provided in DATA.

2) After the JSON, write a short narrative summary (3–5 bullets). 
   - Mention overall claim distribution. 
   - Highlight the top denial categories. 
   - Call out the most frequent remark codes with their business meaning. 
   - Provide 2–3 actionable recommendations for reducing denials.
